## 🧪 Process Followed
   - Imported `Liquor Dataset.csv`, containing transaction data across Indian cities.
   - Used **Power Query** to clean and standardize:
   - Defined relationships between categorical and numerical data
   - Designed Power BI report with visuals like:
   - Bar charts,Line Chart,Pie Chart,Map Visualisation,KPI Cards  
   - Insight Generation**
   - Identified top cities, brands, and time periods
   - Compared regional growth with targets
   - Analyzed category distribution and GST impact

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- City names were inconsistent or misspelled (e.g., "Manglore" vs "Mangalore")
- Region filters weren’t syncing across all visuals initially
- Some visuals (e.g., Map) didn’t render correctly without standardized geodata
- KPI tiles required DAX formulas with conditional logic
- Managing readability and aesthetics in dark theme layout

## 📈 Future Insights & Recommendations
